## 🌌 Overview  
**WareQ** is a next-gen SaaS platform — a cinematic, cyberpunk-styled AI system for warehouse, logistics, inventory, finance, suppliers, and customer management.  
Built to be **enterprise-level, secure, AI-powered, scalable, and fast**.  

This project is a **personal cyber journey** by Jacob, designed with:  
- Full Django 5.2.6 + Python 3.13 stack  
- AI modules + API integration  
- Secure accounts & auth system  
- Enterprise dashboards, customers, finance, inventory, logistics, suppliers, support, events, and organizations apps  
- Cinematic frontend (HTML5 + CSS3 + JS with neon cyber animations)  
- SaaS-level design with responsive UI/UX
